Testing the new -tppx functionality
-----------------------------------

1. We will be using a system compiler whilst we hack on this, not OPAM.
2. We need to make an example TPPX processor
3. We need an example program to make use of it
4. We need a plain shell script to compile it up, or we need to modify OCamlmakefile to know about tppx.
